            <p>
                Hello, everyone! Thanks for visiting my website!
                My name is Vickram, and I want to share the story of my journey in the tech world
                —a journey that has been as much about personal growth as it has been about professional success.
                Over the past decade, I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the brightest minds in the
                industry,
                learning invaluable skills, and eventually founding and leading one of the most innovative companies in
                the software world,
                XLaunch.
                <br><br>
                <b>The Beginning: A Year at Amazon</b>
                <br>
                My journey began at Amazon, where I landed an internship right out of college.
                This wasn’t just any internship; it was a deep dive into the fast-paced world of e-commerce technology.
                At Amazon, I was thrown into the thick of things, working on optimizing the algorithms behind product
                recommendations—
                a project that directly impacted millions of users.
                I learned to think on my feet, solve complex problems under pressure, and, most importantly, collaborate
                with a diverse team of engineers and data scientists.
                Working alongside brilliant minds like Dr. Alex Smola, who was pioneering machine learning models at the
                time, taught me the importance of innovation and adaptability.
                The mentorship I received during that year was instrumental in shaping my approach to problem-solving. I
                also made lasting friendships, finding a sense of community with fellow interns and full-time employees
                alike.
                Together, we navigated the challenges of being newcomers in such a vast company, and those relationships
                have stayed with me throughout my career.
                <br><br>
                <b>Seven Years at Google: From Engineer to Innovator</b>
                <br>
                After Amazon, I joined Google—an opportunity that was both thrilling and daunting.
                At Google, I started as a software engineer, contributing to the development of the Google Assistant, a
                project that required not only technical expertise but also creativity and forward-thinking.
                Collaborating with people like Sundar Pichai and Jeff Dean was both humbling and inspiring; their vision
                and leadership style greatly influenced my own.
                During my time at Google, I was fortunate to be a part of the team that worked on the early iterations
                of TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning platform that has since revolutionized AI development.
                This experience deepened my understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning, areas that I
                would later focus on at XLaunch.
                My growth at Google wasn’t just technical. I learned the importance of user-centric design, leading
                cross-functional teams, and driving projects from concept to launch.
                I also built a network of incredibly talented professionals—people who are not just colleagues but
                friends and mentors.
                These relationships were vital as I navigated the complexities of scaling projects and leading teams.
                <br><br>
                <b>XLaunch: Building a Legacy</b>
                <br>
                After seven years at Google, I felt it was time to take a leap of faith and start my own venture.
                I wanted to create something that reflected my vision for the future of software development—
                a company where innovation wasn’t just encouraged; it was the core of our identity.
                That’s how XLaunch was born.
                In just two years, XLaunch has grown into one of the leading companies in the coding and software
                industry.
                As CEO, my role has evolved from writing code to setting the strategic direction for the company.
                We’ve worked on groundbreaking projects, such as developing an AI-driven platform that simplifies coding
                for developers, making it accessible even to those with minimal programming experience.
                This project, which I initiated, has the potential to democratize software development, and it’s
                something I’m incredibly proud of.
                Leading XLaunch has been the most challenging yet rewarding experience of my life.
                I’ve had to grow as a leader, learning to balance innovation with operational efficiency, and making
                tough decisions that affect not just the company but the people who work here.
                I’m grateful to be surrounded by a team that shares my passion and vision—some of whom I’ve known since
                my days at Amazon and Google.
                <br><br>
                <b>The World Beyond Work: Traveling for Growth</b>
                <br>
                While my career has been a significant part of my life, I’ve also made it a point to explore the world
                beyond the office.
                My travels have taken me to places like Japan, Thailand, the U.S., and many more.
                These journeys have been more than just vacations; they’ve been opportunities for learning and personal
                growth.
                In Japan, I was struck by the meticulous attention to detail in everything from technology to daily
                life.
                This inspired me to bring a similar level of precision and care to my work at XLaunch.
                Thailand’s vibrant culture and strong sense of community reminded me of the importance of building a
                supportive and inclusive company culture.
                The U.S., with its diverse landscapes and innovative spirit, has always been a source of inspiration,
                pushing me to think big and pursue ambitious goals.
                These experiences have broadened my perspective, teaching me the value of adaptability and cultural
                sensitivity—skills that are just as crucial in business as they are in life.
                Traveling has also allowed me to build a global network of friends and collaborators, enriching both my
                personal and professional life.
